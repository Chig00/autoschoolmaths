AutoSchool: Mathematics
A Mental Maths Trainer for all ages by Chigozie Agomo.

This program can generate a customisable Maths test for
anyone to improve their mental Mathematics skills.

INSTRUCTIONS:
  Click the start button on the main menu to access the
  configuration menu.
	
  The arrows in the configuration menu can be used to
  modify different values that will customise the test.
  
  When ready, one can press begin to start the test.
  
  The row of number keys should be used to enter the
  question's answer and the enter key submits the answer.
  An answer cannot be submitted if it is not a number.
  
  After all of the questions have been answered, the
  results are displayed, which show the total score
  as a fraction and percentage, as well as a
  question by question breakdown.
  
  2 marks are allocated for each punctual correct answer.
  1 mark is allocated for each late correct answer.
  
  Clicking back or pressing the escape button at any time
  will return the user to the previous menu.
  Clicking quit or pressing the escape button at any time
  on the main menu will close the program.
  
CONFIGURATION:
  Sum range determines the range of numbers that can be
  generated for addition and subtraction questions.
  The operands in addition questions will be inclusively
  inside the range.
  The second operand and the answer will be inclusively
  inside the range in subtraction questions.
  
  Product range determines the range of numbers that can
  be generated for multplication and division questions.
  The operands in multiplication questions will be
  inclusively inside the range.
  The second operand and the answer will be inclusively
  inside the range in division questions.
  If the second operand is zero in a division question,
  it will be converted into a one instead.
  
  Questions sets determine the number of question
  sets in the test.
  A single question set has 4 questions for each
  of the operations tested (+-*/).
  Therefore, the total number of questions asked
  will be 4 * question sets.
  
  Questions time determines the time limit, in seconds,
  for each question.
  If the user takes more time than what is allowed,
  they will not be fully credited for their answer.
  Setting the time to zero will allow for any amount
  of time to be taken per question.
